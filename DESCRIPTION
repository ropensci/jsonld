Description: JSON-LD is designed as a light-weight syntax that can be used to express 
    Linked Data. It is primarily intended to be a way to express Linked Data in JavaScript
    and other Web-based programming environments. It is also useful when building 
    interoperable Web Services and when storing Linked Data in JSON-based document storage
    engines.
