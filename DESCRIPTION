Description: JSON-LD is a light-weight syntax for expressing linked data. It is primarily
    intended for web-based programming environments, interoperable web services and for 
    storing linked data in JSON-based databases. This package provides bindings to the 
    JavaScript library for converting, expanding and compacting JSON-LD documents.
